# ProgressiveStages

![ProgressiveStages logo](src/main/resources/progressivestages.png)

A NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that gives modpack developers complete control over stage-based progression. Define stages as TOML files; ProgressiveStages locks items, blocks, entities, fluids, dimensions, recipes, enchantments, crops, mob spawns, pets, regions, structures, screens, and player interactions until the player has earned the right stage(s).

**ProgressiveStages 3.0.2** turns that foundation into a fully authorable progression platform: declarative per-stage triggers, graph-based stage scope, scripting and command APIs, broad content enforcement, and a vanilla advancement-style in-game map.

## Start here

- **Never configured a stages mod:** follow the zero-assumption
  [ProgressiveStages 3.0 Beginner Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).
- **Want a complete start-to-release course:** follow the detailed
  [Phase 1 Through Phase 19 Guide](PHASES_1_TO_19.md).
- **Need every field, command, integration, and API:** use the
  [Complete Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).
- **Using schema 4 or the localhost editor:** follow the
  [Schema 4 and Editor Rehaul Guide](REHAUL_GUIDE.md), including all thirty feature groups and
  machine-tested three-file examples. The editor works for permission level 3 operators in
  single-player worlds and on dedicated servers. Its simple stage first editor creates a stage
  from a normal name, searches the live modpack registries by category and mod, builds lock,
  allowance, priority, exception, temporary-condition, progression, reward, and cost cards, and
  keeps the three TOML files in an optional advanced source view. Required stages use a visual
  branching builder with all, any, and minimum path policies, ancestry previews, cycle prevention,
  and an upward class-tree layout for independent, evolved, and hybrid paths.
- **Building location, combat, timer, or priority-based access rules:** copy the
  [Temporary and Triggered Locks Guide](TEMPORARY_AND_TRIGGERED_LOCKS.md).
- **Building or approving a release:** follow the
  [Testing Handbook](TESTING.md).
- **Learning how the files and runtime fit together:** read the
  [Architecture and Project Structure Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Publishing the project page:** copy the maintained
  [CurseForge 3.0 Description](CURSEFORGE.md).
- **Want known-good files to copy:** use the tested
  [Beginner Pack](examples/beginner_pack/README.md).
- **Want to explore the complete first-launch class tree:** use the
  [Fifty Stage Showcase Pack Guide](SHOWCASE_PACK.md).

The older [`diamond_stage.toml`](examples/reference/diamond_stage.toml) remains the fully commented
one-file reference. It is no longer generated into new installations because the fifty stage
schema 4 showcase now demonstrates the editor and class tree directly.

---

## What's new in 3.0.2

- **Reliable single-player editor access.** `/pstages editor` now accepts the authenticated
  loopback browser flow while connected to an integrated single-player server. Permission level 3
  is still required, and remote browser requests remain rejected.
- **Simpler stage editor.** The editor uses a restrained dark gray and gold layout centered on
  stages, the easy builder, player layout, TOML source, validation, and review. Advanced tools
  remain available without crowding the primary workflow.
- **Optional inventory button.** Set `client.show_inventory_button = false` to remove the
  progression map button from the survival inventory without disabling commands or the optional
  keybind.
- **Move and resize the inventory button.** Configure `inventory_button_x`,
  `inventory_button_y`, `inventory_button_width`, `inventory_button_height`, and
  `inventory_button_icon_size` under `[client]`. Positions are relative to the inventory, and the
  centered lock icon automatically shrinks to fit.

---

## What's new in 3.0.1

- **Everything selector.** Rules can use `all:*` to match every registered entry in the selected
  category. Items means every item, fluids means every fluid, structures means every structure,
  and so on. Parent linked exceptions and normal priority resolution still apply, so a broad rule
  can safely keep selected IDs, mods, tags, or names available.
- **Multiplayer safe entity presence.** Entity rules now include the `presence` action. If every
  player inside simulation distance is denied a mob, its spawn is cancelled. If nearby players
  disagree, the mob remains for allowed players and is concealed only from denied players. Denied
  players cannot render, target, attack, interact with, or mount that entity. Denied mobs cannot
  target or damage those players. An owned negative stage uses `effect = "deny"`, while a normal
  missing stage progression gate uses `effect = "lock"`.

---

## What's new in 3.0

- **Fifty stage first-launch showcase tree** — an empty stages directory now receives exactly three
  beginner paths, nine evolutions, nine direct masteries, nine merged classes, six stackable
  engineers, four mutually exclusive mining modes, five temporary powers, four world gates, and an
  at-least-three Grandmaster finale. Configurable stage slots can deny a choice, replace the oldest
  choice, replace the lowest-priority choice, replace every active choice, or allow every buff to
  stack. Existing packs are never overwritten or injected with showcase stages.
- **Direct category picker and repaired maps** — the in-game progression menu opens a category list
  instead of cycling one category per click. The editor graph adds category filtering, search with
  prerequisite context, curved connectors that follow dragged nodes, crossing reduction, zoom,
  true fit-to-panel behavior, exact player-map coordinates, drag placement, arrange-and-save, and a
  real automatic-layout reset that removes manual coordinates instead of overlapping nodes at zero.
- **Item-purchased classes in the easy editor** — **How players obtain this stage** now has a
  searchable live-registry payment builder. Choose items and amounts plus optional XP, cooldown,
  trigger bypass, and revoke refund. The in-game tree uses the existing atomic server-authoritative
  purchase engine. Cost summaries use readable translated names such as `12x Gold Ingots, 2s
  cooldown` instead of registry paths. The showcase uses exactly two purchased beginner paths and
  one gameplay-triggered beginner, while only fifteen of fifty stages are purchases.
- **Selector-based `[[drop_modifiers]]`** — target source blocks, final output items, optional tools,
  enchantments, owned or missing stages, conditions, priorities, caps, and exclusive stacking. The
  showcase Diamond Engineer costs 32 diamonds and doubles only final diamond drops produced with
  Fortune from diamond or deepslate diamond ore.
- **Temporary and triggered lock rules** — `[[temporary_locks]]`, `[[temporary_unlocks]]`, `[[triggered_locks]]`, and `[[triggered_unlocks]]` apply priority-based locks or permissions by dimension, structure, biome, height, health, stage state, effect, movement state, KubeJS predicate, combat, attack, hurt, kill, command, or API timer. A single rule can target items, blocks, fluids, entities, recipes, dimensions, structures, and `jump`/`elytra`/`sprint`/`swim`/`climb`, with per-rule exceptions. Static gates are priority `0`, conditional rules default to `100`, the highest priority wins, and a lock safely wins an equal-priority tie.
* **Vanilla advancement style stage map.** `/stage`, `/stages`, `/pstages`, `/stage gui`, the keybind, or the lock button beside the inventory recipe book button opens a draggable and mouse wheel zoomable progression graph using vanilla task, goal, and challenge frames, dependency connectors, tiled backgrounds, hover cards, search, owned stage filtering, click to pin details, trigger progress, unlock previews, and server validated purchases. Set `client.show_inventory_button = false` in `progressivestages.toml` to remove only the inventory button.
- **Author-controlled map layout** — each stage's `[display]` can set `x`, `y`, `frame`, `background`, `reveal`, and `sort_order`; omit `x` + `y` for automatic dependency graph layout. Reveal can be `always`, `dependencies`, or `unlocked`. The React editor's **Player layout** page pans, zooms, drags icons using these same coordinates, draws new prerequisite branches, removes existing branch lines, and saves exact X and Y positions.
- **Named trigger counters** — `type = "custom_counter", counter = "quest_points", count = 10` bridges stage TOML to `/stage counter get|add|set|reset ...` and `ProgressiveStages.counter/addCounter/setCounter/resetCounter(...)` in KubeJS.
- **Expanded KubeJS API** — actual-change `grant`/`revoke`, plus `toggle`, `exists`, slot-aware `available`, `slot` decision details, dependency queries, tag queries/bulk operations, counters, immediate trigger evaluation, and `openGui`.
- **Correctness and dedicated-server parity** — per-stage exemptions and `[unlocks]` are scoped to their owning stage, secondary categories retain every gating stage, mixed team/server-scope dependencies store correctly, reload/stop clears runtime state, biome time is exact for any polling interval, and block/fluid/mod locks now sync to dedicated clients and recipe viewers.
- **Reproducible build + tests** — optional integrations resolve from publisher Maven repositories; a fresh clone no longer needs ignored `libs/*.jar` files.
- **`[rewards]` on grant** — the companion to `[cost]`. `[rewards]` hands a stage's loot out **the moment it's granted**: `items = ["minecraft:diamond:5"]`, `effects = ["minecraft:strength:60:1"]` (`id:seconds:amplifier`), `commands = ["give {player} ..."]` (run as the player at permission 2; `{player}` substituted; singular `command` also accepted), `teleport = "[dim] x y z"` (dimension optional), `xp_levels`, `xp_points`. Fires **once per real grant** — applied to the player who earned/bought the stage (not per team member), not on login/sync — for every cause.
- **Six new `[[triggers]]` conditions** — `reach_y` (state: while current Y ≥ `count`; aliases `altitude`/`y_level`/`height`); `fish` (vanilla `FISH_CAUGHT`, retroactive); `sleep` (vanilla `SLEEP_IN_BED`, retroactive); `ride` (blocks ridden on any vehicle — minecart/boat/pig/horse/strider, retroactive); `biome_time` (seconds spent in a target biome/`#tag`; `count` = seconds or a friendly `duration = "5m"`); and `stage_held_for` (held another stage for ≥ `count` seconds; `count` seconds or `duration = "3d"` — grant times are now recorded for **every** stage).
- **Stage tags + bulk ops** — tag stages with `[stage].tags = ["combat","tier2"]`, then `/stage tag grant <players> <tag>`, `/stage tag revoke <players> <tag>`, and `/stage tag list <tag>`. Grant **bypasses dependencies** and **skips stages already owned**.
- **`[cost]` cooldown + refund** — `cooldown` (or `cooldown_seconds`; accepts `"5m"`) is a **per-player** rate limit between skill-tree purchases (server-enforced); `refund_percent` returns that % of a purchased stage's item/XP cost when the stage is later **revoked**.
- **Ability gating expanded** — `[abilities].locked` gates `jump`, `elytra`, `sprint`, `swim`, and `climb`. The server resolves static and conditional rules, then client and server enforcement prevents predicted movement and animation from restoring a blocked ability.
- **Jade + WTHIT in-world overlay** — looking at a locked **block OR mob** shows a red `🔒 Requires: <stage>` line. Pulled from the **Modrinth Maven** (`compileOnly maven.modrinth:jade:...` / `...:wthit:...`) — not bundled jars, inert when the mods aren't installed. Entity locks are now synced to the client to power the mob overlay.
- **`[display].encrypt_blocks`** — `encrypt_blocks = true` masquerades this stage's exact-id locked **blocks** as `encrypt_as` (default `minecraft:stone`) until owned, reusing the ore-spoof pipeline (chunk rewrite, break-speed, drop replacement). Per-stage on/off.
- **Authoring / debug commands** — `/stage simulate [player]` (dry-run: reachable-next stages with % and which conditions are short, plus dep-blocked stages); `/stage new <id>` (scaffold a stage TOML); `/stage export` (write a markdown progression guide to the config folder).
- **Three finer-grained gates (now shipped — were "planned" in earlier 3.0 drafts):**
  - **Stage-aware enchantment selection** — `[enchants].locked` removes locked candidates before enchanting-table and player-aware loot rolls. `max_levels = ["minecraft:sharpness:3"]` limits generated and retained levels. `selection_weights = ["minecraft:mending:0", "minecraft:fortune:10"]` changes exact enchantment roll weights until the stage is owned; weight `0` prevents new rolls without stripping existing copies. The immediate loot pass and periodic inventory scan remain safety nets.
  - **`[beacon].locked`** — `locked = ["id:minecraft:strength", "id:minecraft:haste"]` (MobEffect ids). A player missing the gating stage simply doesn't receive that beacon effect; other players in range are unaffected.
  - **`[brewing].locked`** — `locked = ["id:minecraft:strength", "id:minecraft:swiftness"]` (Potion ids). A player missing the gating stage can't TAKE the brewed potion out of a brewing stand's slots (it brews and sits there until they unlock it). Hopper/automation extraction is gated too, best-effort via the nearest player.
- **Stage map search + reveal controls** — search by stage name, id, description, category, or **locked item id**; hide owned stages; use per-stage `reveal` rules to conceal future branches until prerequisites are met.
- **EMI + JEI both optional (reload-crash fix)** — locked items/recipes are hidden and re-shown on unlock in EMI **and** JEI; both are `type = "optional"` (EMI mixins `required: false`) so neither is a hard dependency, and the recipe-viewer reload no longer crashes when EMI is absent (a `NoClassDefFoundError` class-load guard was fixed).

---

## What's new in 2.5

- **`[professions]` lock category** — `[professions].locked = ["id:minecraft:weaponsmith", "mod:somemod", "name:cleric"]` gates **opening a villager's trade GUI by the villager's PROFESSION**. A player lacking the gating stage can't trade with that villager at all (vs. `[trades]`, which hides individual offers by result item). `id:` / `mod:` / `name:` matching (no tags). Wandering traders have no profession and are unaffected — use `[trades]` for those. Fully opt-in (no overhead when unused).
- **`[advancements]` lock category** — `[advancements].locked = ["id:minecraft:nether/root", "mod:somemod"]` **hides locked advancements from the advancements screen entirely** — server-side, the client is never even told they exist. When the gating stage is gained, a full advancement re-send makes them pop into view (no relog). `id:` / `mod:` / `name:` matching; opt-in fast-path when unused.
- **Structure gating enhancements** — `[structures]` now supports `entry_padding` (an integer block buffer that places repelled players well clear of the boundary; also accepted under `[structures.rules]`), and a player who breaches a gated structure is now teleported **back to their last safe position** (where they last stood outside any locked structure) rather than just shoved to the nearest edge.
- **New `[[triggers]]` conditions** — `world_time` (aliases `time_of_day`/`daytime`/`clock`: the current time-of-day tick `0..23999`, e.g. trigger at night); `breed` now takes an **optional** species/tag target (no target = all bred animals, retroactive; with a target = that species/tag, event-counted); `kill_with` now accepts a **`#tag`** victim (summed over the tag's members); and `script` (aliases `js`/`kubejs`/`custom`: a fully custom condition evaluated by a KubeJS-registered predicate via `type="script", id="<conditionId>"`).
- **Datapack-loaded stages** — stage TOML files can ship inside datapacks at `data/<namespace>/progressivestages/stages/*.toml`. They load at world load and on `/reload` and merge with the config-folder stages — **a config file with the same stage id always wins**, so datapacks provide overridable defaults.
- **`[stage]` hidden / color / category now work in the GUI** — previously parsed but inert. Now `hidden = true` omits the stage from the Stage Tree, `color = "#RRGGBB"` tints the stage name (status colour is the fallback), and `category = "..."` shows as a tag in the detail header.
- **Deep KubeJS integration** — a KubeJS plugin binds a global `ProgressiveStages` object: `onGranted`/`onRevoked` callbacks that fire on **every** engine grant/revoke (commands, triggers, quest rewards, skill-tree purchase, regression), `condition('id', player => bool)` to register custom `script:` trigger conditions, plus `has` / `grant` / `revoke` / `list` / `percent` helpers. (Corrects a prior doc claim: KubeJS 7.x has **no** native stage events that fire on engine grants — `onGranted`/`onRevoked` are the reliable hook.) Reset each server-script reload.
- **Deeper `/stage validate`** — now detects full multi-node dependency cycles (not just self-loops), transitively-unreachable stages, and dead trigger targets (a `[[triggers]]` condition whose exact-id entity/block/item/effect — or `kill_with` item — doesn't resolve). Profession ids are validated too.

---

## What's new in 2.4

- **`[attribute]` stage buffs** — a stage can grant attribute modifiers (`[[attribute]]` with `id` / `operation` / `amount`) that apply while the team **owns** the stage. Any vanilla or modded attribute (`minecraft:generic.max_health`, `generic.scale`, `generic.movement_speed`, …), `add` / `multiply_base` / `multiply_total` operations. Applied on grant/login, removed on revoke (transient, reconciled); current health clamps down if max health drops.
- **`[revoke]` + temporary stages (regression)** — stages can now be *lost*. `[revoke]` supports `on_death = true`, `xp_below = N` (XP-maintained — hold the stage only while total XP ≥ N), and `cascade = true` (also revoke dependents). `[stage].duration = "30m"` makes a temporary stage that auto-expires after that much **real** time (counting down even while offline; units `s`/`m`/`h`/`d`, bare number = minutes). Both report `StageCause.REGRESSION`.
- **`[cost]` skill-tree stages** — a `[cost]` table (`xp_levels`, `items = ["minecraft:diamond:5", …]`, `bypass_requirements`) makes a stage **purchasable** from an Unlock button in the in-game tree GUI (`/stage gui`). Purchases are fully server-validated (no double-spend / bypass) and report `StageCause.PURCHASE`. `bypass_requirements = true` skips the `[[triggers]]` (but never the prerequisite stages).
- **New `[[triggers]]` condition types** — `effect` (currently has a status effect), `breed`, `day_count` (reached world day N), `weather` (`rain`/`thunder`/`clear`, one-shot), `enter_structure` (one-shot), `tame`, and `kill_with` (kill `entity` while holding `with`). `tame` / `kill_with` use mod-tracked counters; the rest read vanilla stats or live state.
- **`[unlock]` unlock juice** — optional `toast`, `title` + `subtitle`, `sound`, `particle`, `progress_nudges` (chat hints at 50/75/90%), and `hud_bar` (a blue "progress to next stage" bar above the XP bar). Every field is optional; absent = off. (Note: singular `[unlock]` ≠ plural `[unlocks]` carve-outs.)
- **`[abilities]` gating** — `[abilities].locked = ["elytra"]` blocks elytra gliding until the stage is owned (dropped out of flight each tick). Other movement abilities are better done via `[attribute]` or KubeJS.
- **New `[stage]` metadata** — `hidden = true` (hide from the GUI tree), `color = "#55FF55"` (GUI tint / `&`-code), `category = "…"` (group label), and `scope = "server"` (a **server-wide** stage — the first team to satisfy it unlocks it for everyone; default `"team"`).
- **First-class KubeJS stages** — PS stages work through the normal `player.stages.has(...)` / `.add(...)` / `.remove(...)` API and fire `PlayerEvents.stageAdded` / `stageRemoved`. The Java `StageChangeEvent` (NeoForge bus) now carries `PURCHASE` / `REGRESSION` causes alongside `COMMAND` / `TRIGGER` / etc.

---

## What's new in 2.3

- **Per-stage `[[triggers]]`** — auto-grant triggers now live inside each stage's TOML (the global `triggers.toml` is gone). Each `[[triggers]]` block is one OR-ed rule of `all_of` / `any_of` conditions over kills, mining, crafting, pickups, item use/drop/breaking, distance travelled, raw statistics, play time, level/XP, inventory holdings, advancements, dimensions, and biomes. Counter conditions read vanilla statistics, so they're retroactive and need no extra save files.
- **In-game Stage Tree viewer** — an "Open Progression Tree" keybind (unbound by default) and `/stage gui` open a read-only two-pane screen: a status-coloured stage tree on the left, and the selected stage's description, prerequisite checklist, live `[[triggers]]` % progress, and an icon grid of the items it unlocks on the right.
- **Per-stage `[display]` overrides** — `display_as_unknown_item`, `obscure_icon` (mask the icon with a `?`), `show_tooltip`, and `show_description_on_tooltip` let a stage override the global tooltip/icon defaults for its own locked items.
- **Per-stage `[enforcement]` overrides** — a stage's `[enforcement]` can now override the global enforcement toggles (`block_item_use`, `block_item_pickup`, `block_item_inventory`, `block_block_placement`, `block_block_interaction`, `block_dimension_travel`, `block_entity_attack`, `block_screen_open`, `block_crop_growth`, `block_pet_interact`) for just that stage's gated resources — opt a stage out of (or in to) a category without touching global config. Most-restrictive-wins where several stages gate the same resource.
- **Triggers respect dependencies** — a stage's `[[triggers]]` no longer auto-grant until all of its `dependency` prerequisites are owned; counter progress keeps accruing in the meantime. Omit a stage's `dependency` to let its triggers fire freely.

---

## What's new in 2.0

- **Unified prefix lock model** — `all:*`, `id:`, `mod:`, `tag:`, `name:` (no prefix = `id:`) replace v1's scattered `items` / `item_tags` / `item_mods` arrays. One list, one syntax.
- **Multi-stage gating** — the same item can be locked by multiple stages simultaneously. The player must own **all** gating stages to access it. First-match-wins is gone.
- **Per-stage `[unlocks]` carve-outs** — a stage can lock an entire mod yet exempt specific items via its own `[unlocks]` list. Unlike v1's global per-category whitelist, each stage's carve-outs are scoped to that stage.
- **`minecraft = true` shorthand** — equivalent to `mods = ["minecraft"]`, with parent-stage inheritance: granting a child stage that doesn't itself set `minecraft = true` doesn't leak vanilla content the parent had locked.
- **New lock categories**: enchantments, crops, mob spawns, mob replacements (substitute on spawn), pet taming/breeding/commanding, regions, structures, screens, interactions, curio slots.
- **Vanilla inventory lock icons** — an `IItemDecorator` paints the lock overlay in chests, hotbar, modded backpacks, anvils — every Slot the game renders. EMI's panel still uses the dedicated SlotWidget mixin; JEI's own greying is honored via call-stack detection.
- **Anvil gate** — `AnvilMenuMixin` clears the result slot when input/result is stage-locked, so anvils can't repair, rename, or combine locked items.
- **Visual Workbench compat** — block locks apply through VW-replaced workbenches via reflective resolution to the underlying vanilla block.
- **Reveal-stage-names-only-to-operators** — non-ops see generic lock messages without the stage name (spoiler control); ops always see the full stage.
- **Every player-visible message is a config template** with `&` color codes and named placeholders (`{stage}`, `{type}`, `{count}`, `{player}`, `{progress}`, ...). Pack devs can retheme the entire UX from `progressivestages.toml`.
- **JEI deep hiding** — multi-`FluidStack` ingredient-type enumeration, two-pass refresh (JEI clears the blacklist on add), reflective `IngredientFilter.rebuildItemFilter()`, JEI uid embedded namespace regex, generic ingredient sweep for Mekanism gases/pigments via `Class.getModule().getName()`.
- **EMI hide-by-class** — `removeEmiStacks` predicate covers items, fluids, abstract ids, AND class-module owning mod, catching Mekanism chemicals whose registry id is `mekanism:*` but whose class lives in the mekanism module.
- **FTB Quests deep gating** — the `Quest` / `Chapter` `required_stage` field now also gates `TeamData.canStartTasks`, so progression is blocked even if visibility is overridden by another mod. Optional `ftbquests_team_mode` reflectively delegates `has` / `add` / `remove` to FTB Teams' `TeamStagesHelper`.
- **Spectator bypass parity** — spectators always bypass locks (matching the existing creative-bypass pathway).
- **`reapply_starting_stages_on_login`** opt-in lets pack devs add a starting stage to an existing world and have all online players pick it up next login.

## Installation

1. Install [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/) for Minecraft 1.21.1.
2. Drop the jar into `mods/`.
3. Optional integrations (auto-detected when their mods are present): EMI, JEI, FTB Quests + FTB Library, FTB Teams, Curios, Lootr, Mekanism, KubeJS, NaturesCompass, Visual Workbench.
4. Launch the game once. ProgressiveStages generates the main file at `config/progressivestages/progressivestages.toml` and fifty schema 4 showcase packages under `config/progressivestages/stages/` when that folder is empty.
5. Run `/pstages editor` as a permission level 3 operator to open the local React stage editor. It opens directly on the stage list. Use the guided stage workspace, the movable and zoomable Player UI, Registry, Settings, or Extensions without touching a file. Direct TOML remains available under Source. Reload at runtime with `/pstages reload`.

---

## Quick Start

This compact legacy one-file example is still valid if you create
`config/progressivestages/stages/iron_age.toml` yourself:

```toml
[stage]
id             = "iron_age"
display_name   = "Iron Age"
dependency     = ["stone_age"]
unlock_message = "&6&lIron Age Unlocked!"

[items]
locked = [
    "id:minecraft:iron_pickaxe",
    "mod:create",
    "tag:c:gems/diamond",
    "name:steel"
]
# Per-category whitelist: the Create wrench is exempt from any of the locks above.
always_unlocked = ["id:create:wrench"]

[blocks]
locked = ["id:minecraft:enchanting_table"]

[fluids]
locked = ["id:minecraft:lava"]
```

Grant it in-game:

```
/stage grant YourName iron_age
```

The same player can be required to also have `tutorial_done` to use a specific item by listing it under both stages' `[items].locked` — multi-stage gating happens automatically.

---

## Lock Categories

Each category lives in its own TOML section. Lists accept the unified prefix syntax: `all:*`, `id:`, `mod:`, `tag:`, `name:` (no prefix defaults to `id:`).

| Section | Field | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `[items]` | `locked`, `always_unlocked` | Block use, pickup, holding in inventory/hotbar |
| `[blocks]` | `locked`, `always_unlocked` | Block placement and right-click interaction |
| `[fluids]` | `locked`, `always_unlocked` | Pickup/place buckets, hide from EMI/JEI, prevent submersion effects |
| `[dimensions]` | `locked` (exact ids only) | Cancel travel, eject players from locked dimensions |
| `[entities]` | `locked`, `always_unlocked` | Legacy complete presence gate. Cancel spawns when every nearby player is denied. Conceal mixed access entities per player. Block attacking, interaction, mounting, mob targeting, and mob damage for denied players. Schema 4 can instead choose `presence`, `attack`, `interact`, or `mount`. |
| `[recipes]` | `locked_ids`, `locked_items` | `locked_ids` blocks specific recipe IDs; `locked_items` blocks every recipe producing the output item |
| `[enchants]` | `locked`, **`max_levels`**, **`selection_weights`** | Filter table and player-aware loot candidates before they roll, refuse locked anvil and trade results, and sanitize generated loot and inventories. `max_levels = ["minecraft:sharpness:3", ...]` limits generated and retained levels. `selection_weights = ["minecraft:mending:0", ...]` changes exact enchantment roll weights until the stage is owned; weight `0` prevents generation without stripping existing copies. |
| `[crops]` | `locked`, `always_unlocked` | Block planting, growth ticks, bonemeal application |
| `[screens]` | `locked` | Block opening container / GUI blocks |
| `[professions]` | `locked` | **New in 2.5.** Gate opening a villager's trade GUI by the villager's PROFESSION (`id:`/`mod:`/`name:`; no tags). Wandering traders unaffected (use `[trades]`). |
| `[advancements]` | `locked` | **New in 2.5.** Hide locked advancements from the advancements screen entirely (server never tells the client they exist; re-sent when the stage is gained). `id:`/`mod:`/`name:`; no tags. |
| `[loot]` | `locked` | Filter locked items out of loot tables and mob/block drops |
| `[pets]` | `locked_taming`, `locked_breeding`, `locked_commanding` | Block taming, breeding, or commanding specific entity types |
| `[curios]` | `locked_slots` | Block equipping into specific Curios slot ids |
| `[mobs]` | `locked_spawns` | Cancel only when every relevant player inside server simulation distance is denied. Mixed access preserves the mob for allowed players and conceals it from denied players. |
| `[[mobs.replacements]]` | `target`, `replace_with` | Substitute one mob type for another at spawn |
| `[[interactions]]` | `type`, `held_item`, `target_block` / `target_entity`, `description` | Block right-click / item-on-block / item-on-entity combos |
| `[[regions]]` | `dimension`, `pos1`, `pos2`, `prevent_entry`, `prevent_explosions`, ... | 3D bounding-box gates |

| `[display]` (3.0) | `encrypt_blocks`, `encrypt_as` | **New in 3.0.** `encrypt_blocks = true` masquerades this stage's exact-id locked **blocks** as `encrypt_as` (default `minecraft:stone`) until owned, via the ore-spoof pipeline. Per-stage on/off |
| `[beacon]` | `locked` | **New in 3.0.** `locked = ["id:minecraft:strength", ...]` (MobEffect ids; `id:`/`mod:`/`name:`). A player missing the gating stage doesn't receive that beacon effect; other players in range are unaffected |
| `[brewing]` | `locked` | **New in 3.0.** `locked = ["id:minecraft:strength", ...]` (Potion ids; `id:`/`mod:`/`name:`). A player missing the gating stage can't TAKE the brewed potion out of a brewing stand's slots; hopper/automation extraction is gated too (best-effort, nearest player) |
| `[stage]` metadata | `hidden`, `color`, `category`, `scope`, `duration`, **`tags`** | **New in 2.4** (`hidden`/`color`/`category` GUI behaviour **activated in 2.5**; `tags` **New in 3.0**). Hide from the GUI tree, tint the stage name (`#RRGGBB`), group label/tag, `scope = "server"` (server-wide stage), temporary `duration` (auto-expires after real time), and `tags = ["combat","tier2"]` (labels for `/stage tag ...` bulk ops — no gating effect) |
| (root) | `minecraft = true` | Shorthand: equivalent to `mods = ["minecraft"]` across items/blocks/fluids/entities |

Two whitelist mechanisms exist:

- **`always_unlocked`** inside a category — exempts specific entries from THIS stage's locks within THAT category. Simple and local.
- **`[unlocks]` table** — per-stage carve-outs that subtract this stage from the multi-stage gating set for items / mods / fluids / dimensions / entities. Use this when a stage owns a broad lock (e.g., `mod:create`) and you want a specific carve-out that survives even if other stages also gate the same resource.

---

## Multi-Stage Gating

When two or more stages list the same resource under their category section, the player must own **all** gating stages to access it.

```toml
# stage_A.toml
[stage]
id = "stage_A"

[items]
locked = ["id:minecraft:diamond"]
```

```toml
# stage_B.toml
[stage]
id = "stage_B"

[items]
locked = ["id:minecraft:diamond"]
```

A player with only `stage_A` still can't use diamond — they need both `stage_A` and `stage_B`. This lets pack devs split a single resource between two progression branches (e.g. "you must clear the questline AND defeat the boss").

The single-stage accessor `getRequiredStage(Item)` still exists for callers that don't need the full set; it returns the first gating stage in canonical order. Internally, all enforcers use the multi-stage `isItemBlockedFor` predicate which AND-checks every gating stage against the player's owned set.

---

## Per-Stage `[unlocks]`

Each stage can carve out scoped exceptions from its own locks:

```toml
[stage]
id = "industrial_age"

[items]
locked = ["mod:create", "mod:mekanism"]   # all Create and Mekanism items

# Per-stage carve-outs (scoped — only removes this stage from the gating set):
[unlocks]
items = ["id:create:wrench"]              # Create wrench is allowed
mods  = ["mekanism_tools"]                # Mekanism Tools is allowed even though mekanism is locked
```

The `[unlocks]` table mirrors the lock side and accepts these fields: `items`, `mods`, `fluids`, `dimensions`, `entities`. Each entry uses bare `namespace:path` (or for `mods`, a bare modid) — the `id:` and `mod:` prefixes are accepted but optional in this table.

Carve-outs are scoped to the declaring stage: `[unlocks]` on stage A removes stage A from the gating set for those resources. If stage B independently locks the same resource without its own `[unlocks]` entry, stage B still gates.

For simpler whitelists scoped to a single category, use `always_unlocked` inside that category section instead.

---

## `minecraft = true` Shorthand

Set as a root-level key on the stage file:

```toml
[stage]
id = "civilized"

# Root-level shorthand: gates the entire minecraft: namespace.
minecraft = true
```

This registers a synthetic `mod:minecraft` entry into items, blocks, fluids, and entities for this stage — equivalent to listing `"mod:minecraft"` under each of `[items].locked`, `[blocks].locked`, etc. Useful for "no vanilla anything until you've earned this stage" packs.

**Parent-stage inheritance**: if `civilized` has `minecraft = true` and `iron_age` depends on `civilized` without setting `minecraft = true`, owning `iron_age` does **not** unlock `civilized`'s vanilla locks — the player must explicitly own `civilized` for vanilla content to be reachable. Without this, granting a child stage would silently leak vanilla content the parent had locked.

---

## Automatic Triggers (`[[triggers]]`)

A stage grants **itself** when a player meets its triggers. Declare them per-stage with `[[triggers]]` blocks (the old global `triggers.toml` is gone). Each block is one **rule**; rules are **OR-ed** (any complete rule unlocks the stage). Inside a rule, one or more `[[triggers.conditions]]` combine via `mode = "all_of"` (default) or `mode = "any_of"`; a single-condition rule can put the condition fields straight on the `[[triggers]]` table.

```toml
# Grant when the player mines 10 diamond ore (single-condition shorthand)
[[triggers]]
type  = "mine"
block = "minecraft:diamond_ore"
count = 10

# ...or kills 10 endermen AND the ender dragon (a second, OR-ed rule)
[[triggers]]
mode = "all_of"

  [[triggers.conditions]]
  type   = "kill"
  entity = "minecraft:enderman"
  count  = 10

  [[triggers.conditions]]
  type   = "kill"
  entity = "minecraft:ender_dragon"
```

Condition types: `kill`, `mine`, `craft`, `pickup`, `use`, `drop`, `break_item`, `distance` (blocks travelled, by movement kind or `all`), `stat` (any vanilla custom statistic), `play_time` (minutes), `level`, `xp`, `has_item`, `advancement`, `dimension`, `biome`, and **new in 2.4** `effect` (currently has a status effect), `breed`, `day_count` (reached world day N), `weather` (`rain`/`thunder`/`clear`, one-shot), `enter_structure` (one-shot), `tame`, `kill_with` (kill an entity while holding a given item), **new in 2.5** `world_time` (time-of-day tick `0..23999`, e.g. at night) and `script` (a custom KubeJS-registered predicate, referenced by `type="script", id="<conditionId>"`), and **new in 3.0** `reach_y` (state — while current Y ≥ `count`), `fish` / `sleep` / `ride` (vanilla-stat counters — fish caught, beds slept in, blocks ridden on any vehicle — all **retroactive**), `biome_time` (seconds in a target biome/`#tag`; `count` seconds or `duration = "5m"`), and `stage_held_for` (held another stage for ≥ `count` seconds; `count` seconds or `duration = "3d"`). Subjects accept `#tag`/`tag:` form; `count` defaults to 1. (`tame`/`kill_with`/`biome_time` use mod-tracked counters rather than vanilla stats.) **New in 2.5:** `breed` takes an optional species/tag target (no target = all bred animals, retroactive; with a target = that species/tag, event-counted), and `kill_with` accepts a `#tag` victim (summed over the tag's members). The vanilla-stat counter types read Minecraft's statistics, so they're **retroactive** and survive restarts with no extra save files; `dimension`/`biome` "visited" one-shots are persisted per player (reset with `/progressivestages trigger reset <player> <stage>`). Progress is per-player and the first team member to satisfy a rule unlocks the stage for the whole team. Poll cadence is `enforcement.trigger_poll_interval` ticks (relevant events also force an immediate re-check).

**Triggers respect dependencies:** a stage is not auto-granted by its triggers until every `[stage].dependency` prerequisite is owned. Counters keep accruing while a prerequisite is missing, so the next poll after the last prerequisite is granted completes the unlock. Omit a stage's `dependency` to let its triggers fire freely, regardless of progression.

---

## Stage Tree Viewer & Per-Stage `[display]`

Players can open the **vanilla style progression map** with `/stage`, `/stages`, `/pstages`, `/stage gui`, the "Open Progression Tree" keybind, or the lock button beside the recipe book button in the survival inventory. The `[client]` config can hide the button or customize its inventory relative X position, Y position, width, height, and centered icon size. Drag from empty space or a stage node to pan. Roll the mouse wheel over the map to zoom toward the pointer, from 65 percent through 165 percent. Stage icons stay at a readable size while their positions and connector paths zoom. WASD and the arrow keys pan by the same visible distance at every zoom level. Press Space or use the header home button to center and fit the complete graph. Hover a framed node for its stage card, and click without dragging to pin prerequisites, clearly grouped live trigger routes, unlock previews, and any purchase button. Search matches stage text and locked item ids. The Owned control filters completed stages.

Each stage can override the global tooltip/icon defaults for its own locked items with a `[display]` block — all keys optional, inheriting the global default when omitted:

```toml
[display]
display_as_unknown_item     = true    # mask the item NAME as "Unknown Item"
obscure_icon                = true    # also replace the ICON with a "?" placeholder
show_tooltip                = true    # show the lock / required-stage tooltip lines
show_description_on_tooltip = true    # append [stage].description to the tooltip
x = 168                               # optional explicit map coordinates; omit both for auto-layout
y = 0
frame = "challenge"                   # task | goal | challenge
background = "minecraft:block/deepslate_tiles"
reveal = "dependencies"               # always | dependencies | unlocked
sort_order = 20                        # ordering hint for automatic layout
```

`background` accepts any client texture resource. For a custom file at
`assets/mypack/textures/gui/progression.png`, use `background = "mypack:gui/progression"`.

## Mod Compatibility

| Mod | Integration |
|---|---|
| **EMI** | **Optional** (`type = "optional"`, mixins `required: false`). Items + fluids + abstract ingredients hidden via `removeEmiStacks` predicate; class-module fallback for Mekanism gases/pigments; re-shown on unlock. **3.0:** the recipe-viewer reload no longer crashes when EMI is absent (a `NoClassDefFoundError` class-load guard was fixed) |
| **JEI** | **Optional** (`type = "optional"`, no hard dependency). Items + fluids (every `FluidStack` ingredient type, not just `NeoForgeTypes.FLUID_STACK`) hidden; two-pass refresh; reflective ingredient-filter rebuild; uid namespace regex scan; live `IIngredientListener`; re-shown on unlock |
| **FTB Quests** | `Quest` / `Chapter` `required_stage` field gates both `isVisible` and `canStartTasks`; required-stage entry in the editor config UI |
| **FTB Library** | `StageProvider` Proxy registration so FTB's native Stage Required, Stage Task, and Stage Reward all flow through ProgressiveStages |
| **FTB Teams** | Default backend when `team_mode = "ftb_teams"`; optional `integration.ftbquests.team_mode` reflectively delegates FTB Quests stage reads to `TeamStagesHelper` |
| **Curios** | `CurioCanEquipEvent` gate; per-slot stage locks via `[curios].locked_slots` |
| **Lootr** | `ILootrFilterProvider` filters stage-locked loot from per-player chest snapshots |
| **Mekanism** | Entity-join + block-break hooks honor stage gates; gases/pigments hidden in EMI via class-module detection |
| **KubeJS** | **New in 2.5:** a global `ProgressiveStages` object with `onGranted`/`onRevoked` callbacks (fire on every engine grant/revoke), `condition('id', player => bool)` for custom `script:` trigger conditions, and `has`/`grant`/`revoke`/`list`/`percent` helpers. Also first-class `player.stages.has/add/remove(...)`; Java `StageChangeEvent` (NeoForge bus) carries the `StageCause`. (KubeJS 7.x has no native stage events on engine grants — use `onGranted`/`onRevoked`.) |
| **NaturesCompass** | Filters dimension/structure search results so locked dimensions don't appear |
| **Visual Workbench** | Reflective shim — locks targeting `minecraft:crafting_table` apply through VW-replaced workbenches |
| **Jade / WTHIT** | **New in 3.0:** looking at a locked **block or mob** appends a red `🔒 Requires: <stage>` line to the overlay (blocks via the item-lock cache, entities via a new client entity-lock sync; both honor creative bypass). Sourced from the **Modrinth Maven** as `compileOnly` dev jars, inert when neither mod is installed |

All integrations are reflection-loaded; absent mods are silently skipped. Each can be disabled via the `[integration]` config section.

---

## Configuration

`config/progressivestages/progressivestages.toml` — high-level groups. Stage files live beside it in `config/progressivestages/stages/`:

- **`[general]`** — `starting_stages`, `team_mode` (`ftb_teams` / `solo`), `linear_progression`, `reapply_starting_stages_on_login`, `debug_logging`.
- **`[client]`** — `show_inventory_button`, `inventory_button_x`, `inventory_button_y`, `inventory_button_width`, `inventory_button_height`, and `inventory_button_icon_size`. Hide, move, or resize the survival inventory progression button without affecting commands or the optional keybind.
- **`[enforcement]`** — every per-category enforcement toggle (`block_item_use`, `block_block_placement`, `block_dimension_travel`, `block_enchants`, `block_crop_growth`, `block_pet_interact`, `block_loot_drops`, `block_mob_spawns`, `block_mob_replacements`, `block_region_entry`, `block_structure_entry`, `block_screen_open`, ...), plus `allow_creative_bypass`, `mask_locked_item_names`, `obscure_locked_item_icons` (new — replace a locked item's icon with a `?`), `trigger_poll_interval` (new — `[[triggers]]` poll cadence in ticks), `notification_cooldown`, `reveal_stage_names_only_to_operators`, lock-sound config, eject-blocked-inventory frequency.
- **`[messages]`** — every player-facing string. Supports `&` color codes (`&0`–`&f`, `&l/m/n/o/k/r`) and named placeholders. Generic `*_generic` variants are emitted when `reveal_stage_names_only_to_operators = true` and the player is non-op. Includes the `messages.prefix` template, `messages.tooltip_*` (now including `tooltip_stage_description`), `messages.cmd_*`, `messages.type_label_*`, and `messages.cmd_ftb_status_*` families.
- **`[emi]`** — `enabled`, `show_lock_icon`, `lock_icon_position`, `lock_icon_size`, `show_highlight`, `highlight_color`, `show_tooltip`, `show_stage_description_on_tooltip` (new — append the gating stage's description to a locked item's tooltip), `show_locked_recipes`.
- **`[integration.ftbquests]`** — `enabled`, `team_mode` (delegates to FTB Teams' `TeamStagesHelper`), `recheck_budget_per_tick`.
- **`[integration.ftbteams]`** — `enabled`.
- **`[performance]`** — `enable_lock_cache`, `lock_cache_size`.

The full list of keys is generated into `progressivestages.toml` on first launch with descriptive comments for each.

---

## Privacy & Disclosure

By default, `enforcement.reveal_stage_names_only_to_operators = true`. Non-operators (permission level &lt; 2) see generic lock messages — `🔒 You haven't unlocked this item yet!` instead of `Required: Iron Age`. Operators always see the stage name in chat and tooltips. The flag is mirrored to the client via a dedicated payload so client-side tooltip rendering also respects it.

Set the flag to `false` in `progressivestages.toml` to expose stage names to everyone.

## Changelog

### v3.0.2
- **Integrated-server editor repair** — authenticated localhost editor requests now work for
  permission level 3 operators in single-player worlds while remote hosts, origins, ports, and
  incorrect session secrets remain rejected.
- **Focused editor design** — a restrained dark gray and gold stage-first workspace keeps the easy
  builder, player layout, TOML source, review, and advanced tools available without crowding the
  normal stage workflow.
- **Inventory button controls** — the progression map button can be hidden, moved relative to the
  survival inventory, resized, and given a custom centered icon size. Commands and the optional
  keybind remain available when the button is hidden.

### v3.0.1
- **Generic exact-structure session API** — one-way provider registration for assignment and dungeon mods, immutable instance/bounds/session contracts, three-way `PASS`/`PERMIT`/`DENY` arbitration, cached fail-closed claims, and no hard dependency on companion mods.
- **Committed structure lifecycle** — debounced enter/leave state, idempotent completion, typed death/teleport/dimension/disconnect/recovery outcomes, post-commit NeoForge events, login reconciliation, and team-safe temporary stage leases.
- **Contextual active item locks** — `[active_locks] scope = "structure_session"` blocks selected item use only while the leased in-progress stage is present inside its matching exact session. Inventory, pickup, crafting, loot, tooltips, JEI, and EMI remain untouched.
- **Event-driven structure exits** — `leave_structure` and its aliases support exact IDs or tags, provider filters, required session stages, and typed outcome filters without permanently consuming future visits.
- **Structure diagnostics** — `/pstages structure providers`, `sessions`, `reconcile`, and confirmation-gated `close`, plus a complete provider and forty-step acceptance guide.
- **Conditional access engine** — live location/state rules and event-driven timers can lock or unlock eight target families with explicit priority, safe tie behavior, per-rule exceptions, stage ownership modes, combat entity filters, `/pstages rule` operations, KubeJS bindings, Java APIs, validation, and worked Stronghold/Wither/End examples.
- **Conflict-free map command** — `/pstages` is the dedicated player-facing map command, leaving the previously used short command available to other mods.
- **Nineteen-phase pack-building guide** — a copy-ready path now covers installation, every lock and trigger family, the vanilla-style map, commands, KubeJS, Java integration, optional mods, migration, testing, and release evidence.
- **Progression-map polish** — menu blur stays below the interface, map node icons no longer overlap the pinned inspector, trigger routes are labeled clearly, dragging may begin on nodes or empty space, and a lock button beside the survival inventory recipe-book button opens the map.
- **Custom backgrounds documented and tested** — `[display].background` accepts any namespaced client texture such as `mypack:gui/progression`.
- **Stable camera during live progression changes** — stage grants, revokes, and game-mode changes now refresh ore disguises with targeted block updates instead of unloading the chunk beneath the player. Unchanged scale attribute modifiers are also preserved during stage synchronization.

### v3.0
- **`[rewards]` on grant** — companion to `[cost]`: `items`, `effects` (`id:seconds:amplifier`), `commands`/`command` (run as the player at permission 2, `{player}` substituted), `teleport` (`"[dim] x y z"`), `xp_levels`, `xp_points`. Fires once per real grant (not on login/sync), for every cause.
- **Six new `[[triggers]]` conditions** — `reach_y` (state: Y ≥ `count`), `fish` / `sleep` / `ride` (vanilla-stat counters, retroactive), `biome_time` (seconds in a biome/`#tag`; `count` seconds or `duration = "5m"`), `stage_held_for` (held a stage ≥ `count` seconds; `count` seconds or `duration = "3d"` — grant times now recorded for every stage).
- **Stage tags + bulk ops** — `[stage].tags = ["combat","tier2"]` + `/stage tag grant|revoke <players> <tag>` and `/stage tag list <tag>`. Grant bypasses dependencies and skips already-owned stages.
- **`[cost]` cooldown + refund** — `cooldown` / `cooldown_seconds` (per-player rate limit between purchases; accepts `"5m"`) and `refund_percent` (% of item/XP cost returned when a purchased stage is revoked).
- **Ability gating expanded** — `[abilities].locked` now also gates `sprint`, `swim`, and `climb` (clamps upward motion on ladders/vines), in addition to `elytra`.
- **Jade + WTHIT overlay** — looking at a locked block or mob shows `🔒 Requires: <stage>`. Sourced from the Modrinth Maven as `compileOnly` dev jars, inert when uninstalled. Entity locks are now synced to the client for the mob overlay.
- **`[display].encrypt_blocks`** — masquerades this stage's exact-id locked blocks as `encrypt_as` (default `minecraft:stone`) until owned, reusing the ore-spoof pipeline. Per-stage on/off.
- **Authoring/debug commands** — `/stage simulate [player]` (dry-run reachable-next stages + short conditions + dep-blocked stages), `/stage new <id>` (scaffold a stage TOML), `/stage export` (markdown progression guide).
- **Stage-aware enchantment generation** — `[enchants].locked` now removes every locked candidate before enchanting-table and player-aware loot rolls. `max_levels = ["minecraft:sharpness:3", ...]` limits both newly generated and retained levels. `selection_weights = ["minecraft:mending:0", "minecraft:fortune:10"]` changes exact enchantment roll weights while the declaring stage is missing; weight `0` disables new generation without deleting existing copies. Multiple missing-stage caps and weights use the strictest value. Immediate loot sanitization and the periodic inventory scan remain defense in depth.
- **`[beacon].locked` beacon-effect gating** — `["id:minecraft:strength", ...]` (MobEffect ids). A player missing the gating stage doesn't receive that beacon effect; other players in range are unaffected.
- **`[brewing].locked` brewed-potion gating** — `["id:minecraft:strength", ...]` (Potion ids). A player missing the gating stage can't take the brewed potion out of a brewing stand's slots; hopper/automation extraction is gated too (best-effort, via the nearest player).
- **Stage Tree GUI search + hide** — a search box filters by stage name OR by a locked item id (type an item to find the stage(s) that gate it; flat results), an "☑ owned" toggle hides already-unlocked stages, and the detail pane shows a "Gates mods: create ×42, mekanism ×18" breakdown.
- **EMI + JEI both optional (reload-crash fix)** — locked items/recipes hidden and re-shown on unlock in EMI and JEI; both `type = "optional"` (EMI mixins `required: false`); the recipe-viewer reload no longer crashes when EMI is absent (a `NoClassDefFoundError` class-load guard was fixed).

### v2.5
- **`[professions]` lock category** — gate opening a villager's trade GUI by the villager's PROFESSION (`id:`/`mod:`/`name:`; no tags). Wandering traders unaffected (use `[trades]`). Opt-in (no overhead when unused).
- **`[advancements]` lock category** — hide locked advancements from the advancements screen entirely (stripped from the update packet server-side; the client never learns they exist; full re-send when the stage is gained). `id:`/`mod:`/`name:` matching.
- **Structure gating enhancements** — `entry_padding` (block buffer; accepted under `[structures]` or `[structures.rules]`) and last-safe-position teleport: a breaching player is sent back to where they last stood outside any locked structure.
- **New `[[triggers]]` conditions** — `world_time` (time-of-day tick `0..23999`; aliases `time_of_day`/`daytime`/`clock`); `breed` gains an optional species/tag target (no target = all/retroactive; target = event-counted); `kill_with` accepts a `#tag` victim; `script` (`js`/`kubejs`/`custom`) — a custom KubeJS-registered predicate via `type="script", id="<id>"`.
- **Datapack-loaded stages** — `data/<namespace>/progressivestages/stages/*.toml` load at world load and on `/reload` and merge with config-folder stages; a same-id config file always wins (datapacks = overridable defaults).
- **`[stage]` hidden/color/category now live in the GUI** — previously inert: `hidden` omits the stage from the tree, `color = "#RRGGBB"` tints its name, `category` shows as a tag in the detail header.
- **Deep KubeJS integration** — global `ProgressiveStages` object: `onGranted`/`onRevoked` (fire on every engine grant/revoke), `condition('id', player => bool)` for `script:` conditions, `has`/`grant`/`revoke`/`list`/`percent`. Reset each server-script reload. Corrects the prior doc claim that KubeJS native `STAGE_ADDED`/`STAGE_REMOVED` fire on engine grants — they do not (KubeJS 7.x has no native stage events).
- **Deeper `/stage validate`** — full multi-node dependency cycles, transitively-unreachable stages, dead trigger targets (unresolved exact-id entity/block/item/effect or `kill_with` item), and profession-id validation.

### v2.4
- **`[attribute]` stage buffs** — `[[attribute]]` entries (`id` / `operation` / `amount`) grant attribute modifiers while the team owns the stage; any vanilla or modded attribute, `add` / `multiply_base` / `multiply_total`. Applied on grant/login, removed on revoke (transient + reconciled); current health clamps down if max health drops.
- **`[revoke]` + temporary stages (regression)** — `[revoke]` with `on_death`, `xp_below = N` (XP-maintained), `cascade` (revoke dependents). `[stage].duration = "30m"` makes a temporary stage that auto-expires after that much real time, counting down while offline (units `s`/`m`/`h`/`d`; bare number = minutes). Both report `StageCause.REGRESSION`.
- **`[cost]` skill-tree purchases** — `[cost]` (`xp_levels`, `items`, `bypass_requirements`) makes a stage purchasable from an Unlock button in `/stage gui`; fully server-validated; reports `StageCause.PURCHASE`.
- **New `[[triggers]]` condition types** — `effect`, `breed`, `day_count`, `weather` (one-shot), `enter_structure` (one-shot), `tame`, `kill_with`. `tame` / `kill_with` use mod-tracked counters.
- **`[unlock]` unlock juice** — optional `toast`, `title`/`subtitle`, `sound`, `particle`, `progress_nudges` (50/75/90% chat hints), `hud_bar` (blue progress bar above the XP bar).
- **`[abilities]` gating** — `[abilities].locked = ["elytra"]` blocks elytra gliding until the stage is owned.
- **New `[stage]` metadata** — `hidden`, `color`, `category`, and `scope = "server"` (server-wide stage; first team to satisfy unlocks it for everyone).
- **First-class KubeJS stages** — `player.stages.has/add/remove(...)` + `PlayerEvents.stageAdded` / `stageRemoved`; Java `StageChangeEvent` causes extended with `PURCHASE` / `REGRESSION`.

### v2.3
- **Per-stage `[[triggers]]`** — auto-grant triggers moved into each stage's TOML; global `triggers.toml` removed. OR-ed rules of `all_of` / `any_of` conditions over kills, mining, crafting, pickups, use/drop/break, distance, raw stats, play time, level/XP, inventory, advancements, dimensions, and biomes. Counter conditions are retroactive (read vanilla statistics).
- **Triggers respect dependencies** — a stage's triggers don't grant until all its `dependency` prerequisites are owned; counters keep accruing while waiting. Omit `dependency` to fire freely.
- **In-game Stage Tree viewer** — read-only two-pane master/detail screen. "Open Progression Tree" keybind (unbound by default) + `/stage gui`; left pane = status-coloured stage tree by dependency depth, right pane = selected stage's description, prerequisite checklist (✓/✗), live `[[triggers]]` % progress, and an icon grid of the items it unlocks.
- **Per-stage `[display]`** — `display_as_unknown_item`, `obscure_icon`, `show_tooltip`, `show_description_on_tooltip` override the global tooltip/icon defaults.
- **Per-stage `[enforcement]` overrides** — override the same-named global enforcement toggles (`block_item_use/pickup/inventory`, `block_block_placement/interaction`, `block_dimension_travel`, `block_entity_attack`, `block_screen_open`, `block_crop_growth`, `block_pet_interact`) for just that stage's gated resources; most-restrictive-wins across multi-stage gates.
- **New config keys** — `enforcement.obscure_locked_item_icons`, `enforcement.trigger_poll_interval`, `emi.show_stage_description_on_tooltip`, message template `messages.tooltip_stage_description`.
- **Command changes** — added `/stage gui` and `/progressivestages triggers list`; `/progressivestages trigger reset` now takes `<stage>`; removed `/progressivestages multi list`.

### v2.0
- **Unified prefix lock model** — `all:*`, `id:`, `mod:`, `tag:`, `name:` replace v1's scattered arrays.
- **Multi-stage gating** — player must own ALL gating stages to access a resource.
- **Per-stage `[unlocks]`** — scoped carve-outs, no more global-only whitelist.
- **`minecraft = true`** namespace shorthand with parent-stage inheritance.
- **New lock categories**: enchants, crops, mob spawns + replacements, pets, regions, structures, screens, interactions, curio slots.
- **Vanilla inventory lock icons** via `IItemDecorator` — chests, hotbar, modded backpacks all show lock overlays.
- **AnvilMenuMixin** result-slot gate.
- **Visual Workbench compat** via reflective shim.
- **Reveal-stage-names-only-to-operators** privacy flag with client mirror.
- **All player-visible text configurable** with `&` color codes and named placeholders.
- **JEI deep hiding**: multi-FluidStack types, 2-pass refresh, ingredient-filter rebuild, uid namespace regex, `IIngredientListener`.
- **EMI hide-by-class** for Mekanism gases / pigments / chemicals.
- **FTB Quests `canStartTasks` gate** — task progression blocked even if visibility is overridden.
- **`ftbquests_team_mode`** reflective delegation to FTB Teams' `TeamStagesHelper`.
- **Spectator bypass parity** across every enforcer.
- **`reapply_starting_stages_on_login`** opt-in.
- **Mod compat added**: Curios, KubeJS, Lootr, Mekanism, NaturesCompass, Visual Workbench. FTB Library `StageProvider` proxy.
- **`isValidStageName` regex** validation on `starting_stages` to skip malformed config entries.

### v1.4
- Mob spawn gating with a creeper example in the former default `diamond_age.toml`.
- Tick-based dimension safety net for modded portals.
- Recipe ID lock debug logging in `CraftingMenuMixin`.
- EMI / JEI / FTB Teams / FTB Quests all optional dependencies.

### v1.3
- Linear progression mode (auto-grant dependencies).
- Multiple `starting_stages` support.
- Admin bypass confirmation for missing dependencies.
- Stage definitions sync to client with dependencies.

### v1.2
- Entity locks, fluid locks, name pattern matching.
- NBT-aware EMI/JEI hiding for all stack variants (Mekanism Chemical Tanks, Meka-Suit, etc.).
- EMI search index lock icons via `EmiScreenManagerMixin`.
- Creative-mode toggle instantly refreshes EMI/JEI without relog.

### v1.1
- FTB Quests integration.
- EMI handling improvements.
- Trigger system expanded.
