/**
 * Reconciles the client-side trade index with the server's unfiltered offer list.
 *
 * <p>{@code ServerPlayerMerchantMixin} hides locked offers by sending the client a re-indexed
 * copy of the offer list, but the server's {@link MerchantMenu} keeps the villager's FULL,
 * unfiltered list. {@code handleSelectTrade} then feeds the CLIENT index straight into
 * {@code setSelectionHint}/{@code tryMoveItems}, which index into the unfiltered list — so once
 * a locked offer is hidden, every visible offer after it selects the wrong server-side offer
 * (often the locked one, or an off-by-one neighbour).
 *
 * <p>This translates the incoming client (filtered) index back to the real index in the
 * villager's full list using the SAME {@link TradeEnforcer} filter, so the server selects
 * exactly the offer the player clicked. {@code MerchantContainerMixin} remains the authoritative
 * block for anything that still resolves to a locked offer (e.g. a tampered client sending an
 * out-of-range index).
