            # This generated reference file is named diamond_age.toml. The [stage].id below
            # is the authoritative stage identifier used by dependencies and commands.
            #
            # ==========================================================================
            # READ THIS FIRST. A SAFE FIVE MINUTE EDIT FOR A COMPLETE BEGINNER.
            # ==========================================================================
            # 1. Make a backup copy of this file before changing anything.
            #
            # 2. Lines beginning with # are explanations. Minecraft ignores them. You may
            #    leave every explanation in place while learning.
            #
            # 3. Lines without # are active settings. Change only one active setting at a
            #    time. Save the file after each small change.
            #
            # 4. Text belongs between quotation marks. Keep both quotation marks. A list
            #    begins with [ and ends with ]. Put a comma between entries in a list.
            #
            # 5. The smallest safe customization is changing display_name, description,
            #    icon, and unlock_message in [stage]. These change presentation without
            #    changing the dependency graph or lock rules.
            #
            # 6. The next safe customization is adding one registry id to a locked list.
            #    Example, add "minecraft:diamond_hoe" inside [items].locked. The item then
            #    stays locked until the player owns diamond_age.
            #
            # 7. Do not lock the item or action a player must use to complete this stage.
            #    For example, a mine diamond ore trigger cannot complete if another rule
            #    prevents the player from mining every diamond ore block.
            #
            # 8. Check the file before reloading it.
            #       /progressivestages validate
            #    Validation must report no failed files, duplicate ids, missing
            #    dependencies, dependency cycles, or invalid registry ids.
            #
            # 9. Load a valid edit without restarting the server.
            #       /progressivestages reload
            #
            # 10. Inspect what the server actually loaded.
            #       /stage info diamond_age
            #       /stage progress diamond_age YourPlayerName
            #       /stage simulate YourPlayerName
            #
            # 11. Test the lock before granting the stage, after granting it, and after
            #     revoking it again. This proves both lock and unlock paths work.
            #       /stage revoke YourPlayerName diamond_age
            #       /stage grant YourPlayerName diamond_age
            #
            # 12. If validation fails, read the first reported error, undo the last small
            #     edit, save, and validate again. The previous valid configuration remains
            #     active when a reload candidate is rejected.
            #
            # IMPORTANT NAME NOTE.
            # The repository also exposes this exact text as examples/reference/
            # diamond_stage.toml so it can be read on GitHub. The installed runtime file
            # remains diamond_age.toml and its stage id remains diamond_age.

            #
            # FIELDS (all three are REQUIRED, all three must be exact namespaced IDs):
            #   target       the real block in the world to disguise
            #   display_as   what the client should render instead
            #   drop_as      what mining the disguised block yields
            #                (set this to the display_as item id if you want "stone
            #                that drops cobble" behavior, like vanilla mining)
            #
            # MULTIPLE OVERRIDES:
            #   Add as many [[ores.overrides]] blocks as you want — each is one
            #   target → display_as pair, scoped to THIS stage. Iron, gold, redstone,
            #   lapis can all hide under stone, or each can hide under a different
            #   filler block. Modded ores work the same way — just use the mod's
            #   block ID for target.
            #
            # PER-STAGE NATURE:
            #   These overrides apply ONLY while THIS stage is locked for the
            #   player. iron_age.toml can hide iron ore, diamond_age.toml can hide
            #   diamond ore — each player only sees the masquerade for stages they
            #   haven't earned yet. A player with iron_age but not diamond_age sees
            #   real iron ore and fake "stone" where diamond ore would be.
            #
            # PERFORMANCE — `ore_spoof_radius`:
            #   Goes in [enforcement] below. Cube radius (in blocks) around each
            #   player within which spoof packets are sent. Default 8. Larger =
            #   more accurate visuals when the player walks toward unloaded ore,
            #   smaller = less per-tick work. Server view-distance bounds it
            #   anyway. Recommended 8-16.
            #
            # PLAYER-PLACED BLOCKS:
            #   If a player places real iron ore (e.g. for decoration), it's never
            #   spoofed — only naturally-generated / non-player blocks are masked.
            #   The mod tracks player placements per-dimension in SavedData.
            #
            # DROPS:
            #   When a disguised block is broken, vanilla loot is discarded and the
            #   drop_as item is dropped in its place. Silk-touch and fortune are
            #   intentionally ignored on the gated block — once unlocked, the real
            #   ore returns and silk/fortune work normally.

            # 21. LOOTR INTEGRATION — PER-PLAYER CHESTS, FILTER CHAIN
            # ============================================================================
            # Lootr replaces vanilla loot chests with per-player instances. When both mods
            # are installed, lock enforcement applies at TWO layers:
            #
            #   (a) Our Global Loot Modifier runs on every LootTable roll — including the
            #       rolls Lootr performs per-player. Locked items are removed before Lootr
            #       wraps them in the per-player inventory. This is automatic.
            #
            #   (b) A ServiceLoader-registered ILootrFilterProvider (see compat/lootr/)
            #       plugs directly into Lootr's own filter chain. Our filter runs at
            #       priority 1000 (late) so it operates on the already-populated stack,
            #       removing anything that would still be locked for the player Lootr
            #       identified from the LootContext.
            #
            # USING LOOTR TAGS IN THIS FILE:
            #   Lootr publishes these block tags which you can use anywhere in [blocks],
            #   [screens], or [structures] above:
            #     tag:lootr:chests          — every Lootr chest-shaped block
            #     tag:lootr:barrels
            #     tag:lootr:shulkers
            #     tag:lootr:containers      — everything Lootr considers a container
            #     tag:lootr:trapped_chests
            #
            # BEHAVIOR INSIDE LOCKED STRUCTURES:
            #   Right-clicking a Lootr chest inside a locked structure is refused by the
            #   structure chest-locking guard. Breaking it is also refused (can't skip the
            #   gate by mining). Both covered automatically — no config needed.

            # 23. [[triggers]] — AUTO-GRANT THIS STAGE WHEN CONDITIONS ARE MET  (NEW IN v2.3)
            # ============================================================================
            # v2.3 replaced the old global triggers.toml with this
            # per-stage [[triggers]] section: define the conditions that AUTO-GRANT this stage
            # right here, alongside everything else the stage controls.
            #
            # SHAPE
            #   Each [[triggers]] block is ONE independent RULE. A stage may declare several
            #   rules; they are OR-ed together — the stage is granted the moment ANY rule is
            #   fully satisfied (great for "kill the dragon OR earn the credits advancement").
            #
            #   Inside a rule, list one or more [[triggers.conditions]]. How they combine is
            #   set by `mode`:
            #       mode = "all_of"   every condition must be met   (DEFAULT)
            #       mode = "any_of"   at least one condition must be met
            #
            #   Shorthand: a rule with a SINGLE condition may put the condition fields right
            #   on the [[triggers]] table instead of a nested [[triggers.conditions]].
            #
            # PROGRESS, SCOPE & PERSISTENCE
            #   * Counter conditions read Minecraft's own STATISTICS, so they are RETROACTIVE
            #     (a player who already did the thing is credited the instant the trigger
            #     loads) and survive restarts automatically — no extra save files.
            #   * Progress is per-PLAYER; the FIRST team member to satisfy a whole rule
            #     unlocks the stage for the entire team.
            #   * "Visited" one-shots (dimension/biome) are remembered per player; clear them
            #     with /progressivestages trigger reset <player> <stage>.
            #   * Inspect live progress with /stage progress <stage> [player],
            #     /progressivestages triggers list [player], or the in-game tree (/stage gui).

            # 26. TROUBLESHOOTING — "WHY ISN'T MY LOCK WORKING?"
            # ============================================================================
            #
            # "Items in my locked list aren't locked."
            #   1. Check the item ID exactly — F3+H ingame shows the full registry ID.
            #   2. Check progressivestages.toml — the corresponding global toggle
            #      (block_item_use, block_item_pickup, etc.) must be ON.
            #   3. Check [enforcement] in this file — maybe you exempted the item.
            #   4. Enable debug_logging in progressivestages.toml and reload stages via
            #      /progressivestages reload — the server log will show which locks were
            #      registered for each stage.
            #
            # "My tag: prefix does nothing."
            #   Tag membership is resolved at runtime from datapacks. If the tag doesn't
            #   exist or has zero members, the prefix matches nothing. Check via /tag.
            #
            # "Mobs are still spawning."
            #   Spawn gating uses the server simulation distance. If no player is inside
            #   that distance, the spawn is allowed. If players disagree, the mob remains
            #   for allowed players and is concealed from denied players.
            #
            # "My enchantment policy is not changing automated loot."
            #   Stage-aware generation requires a player in the LootContext. Normal chest
            #   opens, fishing, mob drops, and player-triggered block loot provide one.
            #   Playerless automation uses vanilla generation because there is no player
            #   whose stages can choose a policy.
            #
            # "Players are grief-breaking a locked structure's walls."
            #   Turn on [structures.rules] prevent_block_break. Players also get mining
            #   fatigue V while inside, so even without the flag they can't practically
            #   progress.
            #
            # "Create harvester is still harvesting my locked crop."
            #   Create ultimately fires vanilla BlockDropsEvent, which our GLM filter
            #   catches. If you're still seeing drops, the crop isn't in [crops] or
            #   [loot] — add "mod:croptopia" / "tag:minecraft:crops" / etc.
            #
            # "Mekanism pipes are transferring locked fluids between machines."
            #   Pipe-to-pipe transport doesn't fire vanilla events, so we can't intercept
            #   the transfer itself. Workaround: lock the SOURCE machine block in [blocks]
            #   or [screens]. Players can't open/configure it → pipes have nothing to pull.
            #
            # "Curios items aren't being ejected."
            #   Check server log for "Curios compat active — scanning curio slots". If
            #   absent, either Curios isn't installed or its API couldn't be resolved on
            #   this version. Fall back: add the items to [items] locked instead — Curios
            #   items are regular Items and ItemEnforcer still scrubs them from the main
            #   inventory.
